# SDL2-platformer-example (Linux)
this is a simple platformer project in SDL2 covering all the logic behind a platformer game
the building script works only on Debian based distros, if you are not using a Debian based distro
you can still compile this project as long as you have SDL2 installed, I didn't had time to do a CMAKE file
so this is what I got so far.
